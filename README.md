Assignment submitted to the course of Wireless Networks of the CPGEI Master's Degree program.

The main file is Redes_sem_Fio.m

The codes are commented in Brazilian Portuguese. One GUI interface was created:

The idea is to define a number of nodes and randomly select their locations. The algorithm will compute the best path between two nodes (start and end) selected by the user clicking on the GUI interface.

The button "Mobilidade dos NÃ³s" makes the points move randomly in the screen.
